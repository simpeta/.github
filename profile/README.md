## About Simpeta

**Simpeta** is more than just a name—it's a reflection of our core philosophy and mission. The name is a blend of two elements:

- **Simp** (Simple): Representing our commitment to simplicity. We believe technology should make life easier, not more complicated. By creating programs that are straightforward and intuitive, we aim to make powerful tools accessible to everyone.

- **Eta** (η): Referring to the Greek letter eta, often used to symbolize efficiency in science and engineering. It embodies our dedication to optimizing performance and enhancing productivity through our software solutions.

## Our Mission

The best tools shouldn’t complicate your work—they should seamlessly integrate into your workflow, disappearing into the flow of getting things done. **Simpeta's mission** is to build easy-to-use software that enhances efficiency, empowering users to focus on what matters most: creating value, instead of fighting friction.
